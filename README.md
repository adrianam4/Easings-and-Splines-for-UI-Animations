# Easings and Splines for UI Animations

## 1. Description
I'm [Adri√°n Aroca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adri%C3%A1n-aroca-mascaraque-4570001a2/), a student of the [Bachelor's Degree in Design and Develpment of Videogames at CITM (UPC)](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). This is my personal research for the subject "Project 2" which is given by [Ramon Santamaria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raysan/), the main developer of [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

My main goal in this research is creating a C++ library that let my class mates create his own animations based on easings and splines for their videogames, as easily as possible. Then, I must do a presentation where I will explain all the content i have prepared, in order to everyone can understand what an easing and spline is, and how they work. Moreover, I need to implement a soulution where I will show how I implemented all the easings types in a Visual Studio project. On this project, I will be able to move a player with any Easing type.
