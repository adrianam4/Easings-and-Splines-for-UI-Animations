# Easings and Splines for UI Animations
I'm [Adri√°n Aroca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adri%C3%A1n-aroca-mascaraque-4570001a2/), a student of the [Bachelor's Degree in Design and Develpment of Videogames at CITM (UPC)](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). This is my personal research for the subject "Project 2" which is given by [Ramon Santamaria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raysan/), the main developer of [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
## Introduction and goals
My main goal in this research is creating a C++ library that let my class mates create his own animations based on easings and splines for their videogames, as easily as possible.
Moreover, I must do a presentation for my class mates, where I'll explain all the content I have prepared about this matter, in order to they can understand all about easings and splines, so they will have less problems implementing easings or splines in their projects.
